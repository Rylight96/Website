		<h1>From the City of Island Adventures</h1>
		<p>Once a well-kept secret in surfing circles, the island of Siargao has slowly become one of the most sought-after destinations in the world.<br>
		Discover why this tiny haven with world-class waves, white sand islets, turquoise tide pools, and hidden lagoons was hailed as the world’s most beautiful island back in 2018.<br>
		Premium travel magazine Conde Nast Traveler named Siargao the world's most beautiful island in 2018 and has been chosen as 2021's top island in Asia.
		Since then, all the flights to the tiny, tear-shaped island has been increasing ever since.
		With a total land area of only 437 square kilometers, the entire Siargao Island can be circumnavigated in less than a day. 
		World-class surf spots, sparkling white sand islets, turquoise tide pools, and palm tree-laden lagoons are just within meters of each other. 
		Add to that: They're all within the vicinity of newly opened resorts and restaurants offering local and global cuisine.<br>
		Sohoton Cove is a 60-hectare cove in Bucas Grande Island and is about a one­ hour boat ride from the port in Dapa. 
		It's the idyllic definition of paradise: towering limestone hills covered in tropical plants and hardwood trees like the magcono, aptly called ironwood, framing a shoreline of white sand and tiny shells.
		Hagukan or "snore" in English, Cave produces an echoing sound similar to a human snore-haguk, in the local tongue-when the waves lap against its walls. 
		To enter the cave, one must swim through a narrow passageway leading to water with a luminescent sapphire glow. Nearby, another cave called the Magkukuob Cave is covered in shimmering stalactites and stalagmites. 
		To exit the cave, one has to climb up a cliff and jump off!<br><br>
		Island-hopping is also a popular activity in Siargao because its nearby islands each offer a paradise of their own. 
		The triple island tour to Guyam Island, Daku Island, and Naked Island is worth blocking off your entire day for.
		Guyam Island is the smallest of the three islands and you can walk around its small patch of sand in less than 10 minutes. 
		Daku or "big" in English, is a bigger island where you can spend most of your day time relaxing. A lunch of seafood and tropical fruits is served on the back of a surfboard or on top of a banana leaf. 
		Finally , Naked Island is a fun but peculiar island because it has nothing but white sand on it. No vegetation or structures can be found. Here, adventurous visitors would pose butt­naked for pictures as a tribute to the tiny island's claim to fame.
